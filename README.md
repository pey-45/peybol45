Hi! My name is Pablo, and I'm a computer engineering student with a strong interest in software engineering and development.
In the past year, I have developed proficiency in programming languages like C, Python, and SQL. Additionally, I have gained a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
Currently, my main focus at the moment is on learning Java and mastering object-oriented programming concepts, alongside delving into graphic interfaces.
